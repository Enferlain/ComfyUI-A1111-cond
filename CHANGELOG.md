and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [1.0.0] - 2026-02-02

### 🎉 Launch!

Stable release on the ComfyUI Registry with full parity verification and security hardening.

### Added

- **Comprehensive Test Suite**: 5 new test categories verifying the scheduler, hooks, node math, tokenizer, and API security.
- **GitHub Registry CI**: Added automated publication workflow for ComfyUI Registry.
- **Project Metadata**: Full `pyproject.toml` and `requirements.txt` integration for standardized distribution.

### Security

- **API Hardening**: Implemented a 255-character query length limit for the `autocomplete` API to prevent long-query DOS attempts.

### Changed

- **Verified A1111 Parity**:
  - Verified `BREAK` isolation logic ensures zero concept bleeding between segments.
  - Confirmed `_apply_direct_scaling` math exactly match A1111 emphasis (multiplication vs interpolation).
  - Verified `normalization` accurately implements A1111 "Mean Rescaling" (Norm vs No Norm).
- **Hooks Scaling**: Improved hook sigma-to-step conversion for better accuracy in low-step (2-4 steps) generations.

### Refinements

- **Memory Management**:
  - Bounded caching for prompt encoding to prevent memory leak on high-volume runs.
  - Explicit tensor cleanup in hook executions.
  - Frontend lifecycle management for `ResizeObserver` and global listeners.
- **Performance**:
  - GPU pre-allocation for per-step embeddings.
  - Shared result caching for cloned hooks in 2nd order samplers.
  - Zero-allocation hot-path for sampling loop swapping.

## [Unreleased] - 2026-01-31

### Added

- Extended JS frontend support to the Negative Prompt Node:
  - **Autocomplete**: Enabled tag autocomplete for negative prompts.
  - **Token Counter**: Header display and detailed tooltip now show for negative nodes.
  - **Sequence Visualizers**: Added blue `BREAK` markers and orange 75-token chunk markers to the negative prompt textarea.

### Changed

- **Smart "Effective Prompt" Visibility**: The expanded prompt view now automatically hides itself when it's identical to the user-typed prompt (e.g., when no TIPO expansion or wildcards are active).
- **Refined Autocomplete Behavior**: The autocomplete popup now suppresses itself when deleting separator characters (comma, space, brackets) via Backspace, preventing unnecessary popups on already "finished" tags.

### Fixed

- Fixed Negative Prompt node missing UI feedback functionality that was present in the positive node.

## [Unreleased] - Pre 2026/1/31 changes

### 🎉 Major Changes

#### Removed MODEL Input Requirement

The node now uses ComfyUI's `TransformerOptionsHook` system instead of requiring a MODEL input. This makes workflows simpler and more intuitive.

**Before:**

```text
MODEL ──► A1111 Prompt ──► MODEL ──► Sampler
CLIP  ──►                ──► COND  ──►
```

**After:**

```text
CLIP ──► A1111 Prompt ──► COND ──► Sampler
```

#### Automatic Step Detection

The node now automatically detects the step count from connected sampler/scheduler nodes by inspecting the workflow graph. No manual configuration needed!

### ✨ New Features

- **Auto-detect step count**: Steps are automatically extracted from downstream sampler/scheduler nodes
- **Simpler workflows**: No MODEL connection needed for scheduling/alternation
- **Smart validation**: Detects if you're using step-based syntax and validates accordingly
- **Works with custom nodes**: Uses generic detection (checks for "steps" input + "Scheduler"/"Sampler" in class name) instead of hardcoded node types

### 🔧 Technical Changes

- Replaced `StepConditioningHandler` with `A1111StepConditioningHook(TransformerOptionsHook)`
- Hook is now attached to conditioning output instead of model
- Added workflow graph traversal via hidden "PROMPT" and "UNIQUE_ID" inputs
- Removed `setup_step_conditioning_on_model()` function
- Updated `create_step_schedule_cond()` to use hook system
- Added `_get_downstream_steps()` for graph traversal
- Added `_uses_step_based_syntax()` for syntax detection

### 📝 Documentation Updates

- Updated README.md with new workflow examples and step detection behavior
- Created MIGRATION_GUIDE.md for users updating existing workflows
- Created MODEL_WRAPPER_ANALYSIS.md explaining the technical details
- Updated TODO.md with completed items

### ⚠️ Breaking Changes

**Node Signature Changed:**

- **Removed**: `model` input (optional)
- **Removed**: `model` output
- **Added**: Hidden `prompt` and `unique_id` inputs for graph traversal
- **Changed**: `steps` parameter now defaults to 0 (auto-detect) instead of 20

**Migration Required:**

- Remove MODEL connections from A1111 Style Prompt nodes
- Connect CONDITIONING directly to sampler
- Connect checkpoint MODEL directly to sampler (bypass the prompt node)
- `steps` parameter is now optional - set to 0 for auto-detection

See MIGRATION_GUIDE.md for detailed migration instructions.

### 🐛 Bug Fixes

- Fixed step detection to work with any sampler/scheduler combination
- Improved handling of sequence length mismatches
- Better error messages when step-based syntax is used without step information

### 📊 Performance

- No performance impact - same wrapper function, different registration method
- Slightly more efficient due to ComfyUI's hook caching system
- Graph traversal happens once at node execution, not during sampling
